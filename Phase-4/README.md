# ⚡ Energy Intelligence — Phase 4: Decision Dashboard

## Overview

Phase 4 is the **decision-facing layer** of the Energy Intelligence system. It is a **Streamlit-based dashboard** that loads a frozen **Phase-3 bundle JSON** and turns model outputs into:

- Clear forecasts
- Actionable recommendations
- A bundle-grounded AI decision copilot

⚠️ **Important:** Phase 4 runs in **snapshot mode only**. There is **no live data** and **no real-time inference** in this phase.

---

## Who This Is For

This dashboard is designed for:

- Energy analysts
- Operators & planners
- Technical stakeholders evaluating forecasting systems
- Recruiters & hiring managers reviewing production-style ML projects

It demonstrates how **ML outputs become decisions**, not just charts.

---

## What the Dashboard Shows

### 💲 Next-Hour Energy Price

- Forecasted electricity price for the next hour
- Displayed in **$/kWh**
- Converted from **$/MWh ÷ 1000**
- Includes forecast timestamp ("as-of") when available

### 📉 24-Hour Demand Forecast

- Line chart of hourly demand (MW)
- Peak demand and average demand metrics
- Optional peak window alerts if present in the bundle

### 🤖 Engy — AI Decision Copilot

- Answers natural-language questions about the forecast
- Uses **only Phase-3 bundle fields**
- Provides:
  - A concise answer
  - Suggested actions
  - Explicit references to bundle fields used

---

## Bundle-Grounded Rules (No Hallucinations)

Engy follows **strict constraints**:

- ✅ Uses **only** the provided Phase-3 bundle JSON
- ❌ No external knowledge
- ❌ No browsing
- ❌ No new forecasts
- If information is missing → **"Not available in this Phase-4 build."**

All answers include **field-level references** back to the bundle.

## Folder Structure

Phase 4 expects outputs generated by Phase 3.

```
Energy-Intelligence/
├── Phase-3/

## How to Run Locally

### 1. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set environment variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

The dashboard will still load without an OpenAI key, but Engy will display a graceful error message.

### 4. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## Limitations (Intentional)

- Snapshot mode only (no live data)
- Depends entirely on Phase-3 bundle schema
- No real-time ingestion or streaming
- Forecast quality is inherited from Phase-3 models
- Some metrics may show "Not available" if absent from the bundle

---

## Roadmap → Phase 5

Phase 5 will turn this into a live system:

- Continuous ingestion
- Automated validation & freshness checks
- API-backed forecasts
- Cloud deployment (AWS)
- Separation of UI, inference, and orchestration layers

Phase 4 proves the decision experience before going live.

## Status

✅ Phase 4 complete  
🟡 Phase 5 planned
